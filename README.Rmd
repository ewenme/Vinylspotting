# vinylspotting

![vinylspotting](vinyspotting_preview.gif)

An app to help [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) users visualise the current state, and evolution of, their record collection and buying habits.

## Use

Visit [apps.ewen.io/vinylspotting](https://apps.ewen.io/vinylspotting/) to use `vinylspotting`.

1. Enter your Discogs user name
2. Have a look around
3. Export any visuals you wanna keep

You can also run the app locally, from an R session, by simply running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
runGitHub(repo = "ewenme/vinylspotting", subdir = "inst/shiny")
```

Note: You will be prompted for a Discogs API access token if running `vinylspotting` locally. Refer to [discogger](https://github.com/ewenme/discogger) if you need help.
